Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played between two players, X and O, on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

This project implements the game using React, with each square in the grid represented by a component.

Player X starts the game.
Click on any square in the grid to place your mark (X or O).
Players take turns placing their marks on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
If a player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.
If all squares are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
To restart the game after a win or draw, click the "Play Again" button.
